# CxFlips
Put up money on a coin toss.

# About
CxFlips is a coin-flip system for Garry's Mod. This addon requires the DarkRP gamemode to be used since it uses its money system. Users are able to bet some, or all, of their money on a simple coin toss. After a coin flip is created, another player is allowed to join and bet their money, whoever wins gets the pool.
